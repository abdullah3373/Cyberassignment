# SecureFin - Mini FinTech App (Assignment 2)

This project is a compact Streamlit-based FinTech demo app prepared for the CY4053 assignment.
Run `streamlit run app.py` after installing requirements. See README_for_submission.md for manual test instructions and how to fill evidence.

Note: passlib is optional. If not installed, the app falls back to PBKDF2 for password hashing.
